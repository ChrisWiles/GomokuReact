an _m_×_n_ board, the winner being the player who first
gets _k_ stones of their own color in a row, horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally.Thus, [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) is the 3,3,3-game and
free-style [gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku) is the 19,19,5-game. _m,n,k_-game

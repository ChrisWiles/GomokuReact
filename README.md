## Gomoku



**Gomoku** is an [abstract
strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_strategy) [board
game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game). Also called **Gobang** or **Five
in a Row**, it is traditionally played with [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) pieces
(black and white stones) on a go board with 19x19 (15x15) intersections.

The winner is the first
player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or
diagonally.

 

## m,n,k-game

An **_m,n,k_-game** is an
abstract [board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game) in
which two [players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_(game)) take
turns in placing a stone of their [color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color) on
an _m_×_n_ board, the winner being the player who first
gets _k_ stones of their own color in a row, horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally.Thus, [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) is the 3,3,3-game and
free-style [gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku) is the 19,19,5-game. _m,n,k_-game
is also called a **_k_-in-a-row** game on _m_×_n_ board.
